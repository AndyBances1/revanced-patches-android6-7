# YouTube ReVanced for Android 6.0-7.1
An unofficial ReVanced Extended for YouTube 17.34.36.  
Based on inotia00's ReVanced Extended [v2.160.1](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.160.1)

## About
The last YouTube app available on Android 6 & 7 is v17.34.36.

On the other hand, latest ReVanced and RVX patches don't support YouTube 17.34.36, but RVX v2.160.1 is the last version in which most of features work properly.

So I forked ReVanced Extended patches v2.160.1 and fixed some patches and backported some features for Android 6.0-7.1 users.

Because I released this on the GitHub repository, which means that you can use ReVanced Manager to build YT ReVanced for Android 6.0-7.1!  
(but it requires other Android 8.0+ device)

This is not able in the original RVX patches, as ReVanced Manager cannot select versions of patches/integrations.

## How to build
See [documantation](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches/wiki/How-to-build).

## Todo
Reconstruction based on latest verison RVX patches (for well maintainabilityüîß, updated translationüåç and new features‚ú®)

## Successor wanted!
Embarrassingly, I'm not very familiar with reverse engineering and even programming. (but I can read a little smali. :D )  
So I can not create new patches by myself. All my modifing are just copy and paste.

If a better successor ReVanced Patches for 6.0-7.1 is emerged, I will promptly delete the repository and retire ReVanced community!
